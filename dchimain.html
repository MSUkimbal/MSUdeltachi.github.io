 <p> <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="5em">In 1890 as a Law Fraternity at Cornell University, Delta Chi has evolved into an international social fraternity with chapters all over - at Missouri State University, we, the men of the Delta Chi Fraternity, pride ourselves in giving students a method of getting involved in the campus and surrounding community. Delta Chi at Missouri State is an IFC chapter, and by being associated that way, we host philanthropy events, participate in FSL (Fraternity and Sorority Life) competitions and events, enjoy our brothers' company and ensure our student member's education is in good standing. We prepare our members for the world after their time at Missouri State. Our promise is to give our student members a place to learn, grow, and succeed as young men.<br><br> 

     Delta Chi is a fraternity that sets itself apart from the others - our mission is to develop young men into adults that are prepared for the world in and after college. We set ourselves apart by following Delta Chi's core values: To Promote Friendship, Develop Character, Advance Justice, and to Assist in the Acquisition of a Sound Education. Not only preparing our members for the professional world, Delta Chi emphasizes the importance of friendship and brotherhood - The members of Missouri State Delta Chi will be more than other fraternity members - they will be your brothers, a lasting fraternal bond will be made that will carry itself even after your own college years. Delta Chi is a life-long investment -- Your brothers now, in college, will be your brothers throughout your entire life. </font>
